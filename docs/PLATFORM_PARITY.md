# Cross-platform parity — implementation ledger (2026-10-29)

Scope: all functional gaps across FrameLink and vkrender, not tracing alone.
This ledger is in-progress, not a blanket parity certification.

## Implemented in FrameLink

- Portable `flImageMapPlanes` in the core header; Linux native mapping,
  Windows staging readback/upload, Android native mapping or normalization.
- BGRA, RGBA, NV12 and RGB10A2 allocation paths. Device allocation support
  still matters: Pi Android rejected RGB10A2, tablet and desktop accepted it.
- Android NV12 maps native YUV420 directly when U/V layout is verified as NV12;
  otherwise normalizes planes. Android BGRA maps through native RGBA swizzling.
  AHB handles always expose their native format, not a promise of NV12 bytes.
- Android producer/consumer samples and static GStreamer plugin build.
- Native POSIX completion-FD handoff (`framelink_sync_fd.h`), with bounded
  ready waits, GPU-owned readiness and deferred consumption watermarks.
- `FL_DEFER_RELEASE`: wait for readiness normally but retire storage explicitly
  after GPU reads. Windows uses its existing shared consumed timeline fence.
- Windows now honors ready-fence acquisition timeouts, reserves acquired slots,
  and checks held-frame release identity. Android held-frame resize is refused;
  refused Android resize preserves producer counters and outstanding ownership.
- Android API tracing matches desktop operation/metadata coverage.

**Wire version is now 5.** Rebuild both ends together; old peers are refused.
Native handle APIs are necessarily platform-specific, with equivalent ownership
and completion contracts. Android abstract sockets remain subject to app UID /
SELinux boundaries; renderer cross-app input uses its existing Binder Surface API.

## Renderer work

- Shared CPU/GPU tracing helper and Android intent-based finite captures.
- Linux/Android scene outputs through persistent asynchronous Vulkan readback
  and CPU conversion. Reuses existing frame fence waits. Opt-in fallback,
  not zero-copy and not performance-equivalent to Windows GPU video processing.
- Per-format sampler/pipeline variants support mixed RGB/NV12 native inputs.
  Linux native mixed DMA-BUF pixel test verifies RGB gradient and NV12 red tiles.
- Linux/Android FrameLink recycling now uses explicit deferred release behind
  completed GPU fences instead of fabricating an older flFrame.
- `VKR_INPUT_FORMATS=nv12,rgba,...` chooses per-slot formats. Desktop non-BGRA
  FrameLink inputs use an explicit CPU conversion/upload fallback. Android uses
  AHB format-aware import. Runtime verification of all combinations is ongoing.

## Validation recorded so far

- Linux FrameLink: 24/24 tests, including format maps, ownership and FD contracts.
- Windows FrameLink: 27/27 tests including RGB10A2 GStreamer and ready-fence timeout.
  Includes final resize/GPU-lifetime guard changes.
- Pi + tablet Android: RGBA/NV12/BGRA byte tests, completion-FD tests and GStreamer
  NV12 padded/offset-plane test passed. Final deferred resize regression passed on both devices.
- Linux + Pi dual scene outputs: 20 timestamp-matched RGB/NV12 frame pairs,
  >=17 distinct frames, maximum BT.709 YUV error 1 (limit 3).
- Pi trace capture: 180 GPU duration records, zero trace-buffer loss.
- Windows renderer: 3/3 GPU conversion tests and 60 distinct frames on each
  comparison path passed after mixed-sampler/deferred-release refactors.

## Remaining evaluation / qualification

- Long-running GPU-owned reconnect and process-death stress across all backends.
- Remaining input format combinations beyond verified Linux/Windows NV12 and
  Android mixed native NV12/RGBA.
- Native GPU completion integration now passed Linux, Pi and tablet using
  exported Vulkan SYNC_FD semaphores gated by real queued event waits.
- Android now shares all four layout calculations with desktop, and supports
  L/Space/B/-/=/1..9/0 keyboard controls. Multi-display/control-service parity
  and animated departure resource retention remain open.
- GPU-only scene outputs are now implemented on Linux and capable Android
  devices. Linux uses compute/native plane copies; Android YUV uses external-format
  resolve. Pi native NV12 GPU rendering remains unsupported by its current driver.
  Windows keeps its GPU implementation; these are functionally similar, not
  identical performance paths. See the renderer GPU_OUTPUT.md for qualification.
- Android cross-app transport requires Binder or platform privileges; arbitrary
  cross-app Unix-socket access cannot be enabled by this library.

## Android GStreamer build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-android \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-29 \
  -DFRAMELINK_BUILD_GST=ON \
  -DFRAMELINK_GST_ANDROID_ROOT=/path/to/gstreamer-android/arm64
cmake --build build-android
```

Link static `gstframelink` into the APK and register with
`GST_PLUGIN_STATIC_REGISTER(framelink)` after GStreamer initialization.
The SDK is an external dependency, not vendored.

## Additional verified paths

- GStreamer RGB10A2_LE padded/offset byte roundtrip and incompatible-format
  rejection: Linux, Windows and Android tablet. Pi allocation unsupported.
- Android native NV12 input: 90 submitted / 87 adopted in the measured run.
- Android mixed native NV12/RGBA wall: both producers submitted 120 frames;
  screenshot inspected, both distinct patterned tiles visible. This fixture is
  not an RGB-vs-YUV color-equivalence or no-drop benchmark.
- Shared scene-layout unit test covers all four layouts, portrait/landscape/wide
  canvases and mixed landscape/portrait source aspect ratios.

Android launch extras: `--es layout wall`, `--es inputFormats nv12,rgba`,
`--es sceneOutputs output.rgba,output.nv12`, `--ez trace true`,
`--ez traceGpu true`, `--ei traceFrames 300`. Restart the process to change
launch configuration. Keyboard controls may be sent with `adb shell input keyevent`.

Windows output extension: native Vulkan blit targets now include RGBA and RGB10A2
as well as BGRA; NV12 keeps D3D11 video processing. Both RGBA/NV12 and
RGB10A2/NV12 timestamp-matched output checks passed 20 distinct pairs with
maximum YUV error 1. This renders an 8-bit scene into 10-bit storage; it does
not create additional HDR scene precision. Windows NV12 input fallback rendered
40 frames and its red fixture center decoded to RGB (255,1,0).

Producer/consumer samples now exercise explicit completion mode on all three
platforms. POSIX CPU validation reports completed reads/writes with FD -1; the
separate Vulkan test proves real native GPU fence transfer.

Reproduce Windows integration (isolated build directories, not the live demo):

```powershell
./test/parity_windows_input.ps1 -RendererBuild build-trace -FrameLinkBuild ../framelink/build-trace
./test/parity_windows_output.ps1 -RendererBuild build-trace -FrameLinkBuild ../framelink/build-trace
./test/parity_windows_output.ps1 -RendererBuild build-trace -FrameLinkBuild ../framelink/build-trace -Rgb10
```

The input script checks finite renderer completion; inspect `parity-nvinput.ppm`
for its red fixture. The output script checks 20 timestamp-matched frame pairs,
frame diversity and YUV conversion error. These scripts stop only their own
child processes, not an existing live demo.

## Reconnect lifetime regression (2026-10-29)

Replacement producers now receive `FL_BUSY` while old storage is held or its
completion fence is pending. A successful reconnect starts a fresh generation;
old completion values cannot authorize reuse in the new timeline. Renderer
departure paths retire their final retained frame after GPU reads complete.

- FrameLink suites: Linux 25/25, Windows 28/28 passed.
- Held-frame reconnect and delayed-completion reconnect passed on Linux and
  both Android devices; held-frame reconnect also passed on Windows.
- Renderer NV12 reconnect: Linux completed 30 adoptions; Windows completed
  70 rendered frames across reconnect; Pi producer submitted 90 frames with
  one reconnect and no producer timeouts (renderer trace: 89 adoptions).
- Linux CPU-fallback 640x360 integration exceeded its 15-second test timeout;
  the passing reconnect fixture used 128x72 input. This is not a throughput
  qualification. Long-running GPU/process-death stress remains outstanding.

## GPU-output follow-up

Opt-in FL_GPU_RENDER allocation and strict renderer GPU output mode added.
Linux renderer suite 9/9; FrameLink Linux25/25 and Windows28/28. Windows existing
GPU conversion3/3 and60 distinct frames per RGB/NV12 comparison path still pass.
Native patterned output tests include scaling, chroma, row padding and consumer
recreation/resizing while an output is pending: Linux/tablet4 formats, Pi2 formats
passed with zero byte error. Pi NV12 and RGB10 allocation limits are explicit.
Tablet full Activity comparison remains unverified while screen-locked; native
conversion/lifecycle tests passed. Broad platform integration parity is not complete.
