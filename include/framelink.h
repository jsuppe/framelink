// framelink - zero-copy GPU frames between processes. Portable core.

// SPIKE. This is the Windows backend only, built to test the API shape from
// docs/FRAMELINK.md against a real consumer before committing to it. Scope is
// deliberately narrow: one producer per channel, BGRA8 only, no broker, no
// access control. Those are design questions, not oversights - see the doc.
//
// The ring belongs to the CONSUMER. A consumer calls flCreateChannel and owns
// the buffers; producers flOpenProducer onto a channel that already exists and
// never allocate. That is BufferQueue/AImageReader ownership, which is what
// Android forces and therefore what all platforms use.
//
//   consumer:  flCreateChannel -> flAcquireFrame / flRelease  -> flClose
//   producer:  flOpenProducer  -> flAcquireBuffer / flSubmit  -> flClose
//
// No platform type appears in this header. Turn an flImage into something you
// can draw with via the interop header for your platform (framelink_d3d11.h).
